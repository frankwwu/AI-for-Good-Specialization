# Explore Phase - Exploring the Hurricane Harvey Satellite Image Data

[__Open Lab__](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-and-disaster-management/ungradedLab/snKlm/explore-phase-exploring-the-hurricane-harvey-satellite-image-data/lab?path=%2Fnotebooks%2FC3_W2_L1_Hurricane_Harvey_Explore.ipynb)

## Instructions

In this notebook, you will explore the Hurricane Harvey image dataset. The dataset you will be looking at came from [Detecting Damaged Buildings on Post-Hurricane Satellite Imagery Based on Customized Convolutional Neural Networks](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/sdad-1e56) and was prepared by Quoc Dung Cao and Youngjun Choe on the 13th of December, 2018. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01688.pdf) describes the authors' work in more detail and more [information about the original satellite image data source can be found here](https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/geoeye-1/). Individual images were labeled by volunteers on the [crowdsourcing platform Tomnod, now Maxar Geohive](https://blog.maxar.com/leading-the-industry/2019/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-looking-back-on-nine-years-with-tomnod). This dataset contains aerial-view windows of the affected area classified as damaged or not, along with building coordinates.

In this lab you will apply the following steps:

1. Import Python packages

2. Explore the dataset

3. Prepare the dataset

4. Describe the data

5. Compare pre-disaster and post-disaster images

6. Visualizing classified locations with LeafLet
