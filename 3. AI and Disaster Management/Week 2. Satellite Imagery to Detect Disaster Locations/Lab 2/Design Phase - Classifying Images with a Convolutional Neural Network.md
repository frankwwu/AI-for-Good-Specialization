# Design Phase - Classifying Images with a Convolutional Neural Network

[__Open Lab__](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-and-disaster-management/ungradedLab/AKdM5/design-phase-classifying-images-with-a-convolutional-neural-network/lab?path=%2Fnotebooks%2FC3_W2_L2_Hurricane_Harvey_Design.ipynb)

# Instructions

After exploring the Flood Damage Assessment Dataset in the previous notebook, you will apply the Convolutional Neural Networks to classify whether an area is flooded in a satellite image. You will also evaluate the performance of the Convolutional Neural Networks using a confusion matrix and commonly-used evaluation metrics in machine learning research. To make your Convolutional Neural Networks more robust, you will augment the Hurricane Harvey image dataset.


__In this lab you will apply the following steps:__

1. Import packages

2. Load the training data

3. Augment data

4. Load training data with augmentation

5. Train your model (load pre-trained model)

6. Load the test dataset

7. Test your model

8. Visualize the results
