The __AI for Good Specialization__ showcases how artificial intelligence (AI) is being leveraged to address some of the world’s biggest challenges and equips you with the framework and skill set to be part of the solution.

You’ll learn from experts driving AI initiatives aimed at addressing social and environmental issues from addressing climate change to supporting disaster response efforts. By combining human and machine intelligence, real-world datasets, best practices around data privacy, and ethical considerations, you’ll develop the knowledge and fundamental skills to tackle AI for good projects. These skills will enable you to make informed decisions that not only benefit society but also ensure that your initiatives are effective and sustainable. 

To create this program, we partnered with Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab and lead instructor Robert Monarch, author of Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning and disaster response professional. He brings a wealth of expertise on how AI can be used to support disaster response and other critical applications.

This Specialization is designed to be accessible for everyone. Whether you’re a student, professional, or someone passionate about making a positive impact on society and the environment, this program provides needed tools and knowledge needed to work on AI for good initiatives right away.

Join AI for Good and become part of a community that's committed to using AI for the betterment of society and the planet.
