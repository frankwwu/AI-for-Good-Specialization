## Instructions

In the previous lab, you performed an exploratory analysis of the [SDWPF dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04360), which contains data from 134 wind turbines from a wind farm in China. The SDWPF data was provided by the Longyuan Power Group, which is the largest wind power producer in China and Asia.

In this lab you will begin to design a solution for wind power forecasting. The steps you will complete in this lab are:

1. Import Python packages

2. Load the dataset

3. Catalog abnormal values

4. Establish a baseline for wind energy estimation

5. Perform feature engineering5.1 Delete redundant features - Pab5.2 Transform angle features5.3 Fix temperatures and active power features5.4 Create time features

6. Update linear model baseline with more features

7. Use a neural network to improve wind power estimation
