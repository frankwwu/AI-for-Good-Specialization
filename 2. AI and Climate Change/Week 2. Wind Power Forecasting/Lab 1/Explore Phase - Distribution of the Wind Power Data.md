## Instructions

In this first lab you will perform an exploratory analysis of the Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting or 
SDWPF dataset
, which contains data from 134 wind turbines in a wind farm in China. The [SDWPF data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04360) from Longyuan Power Group Corp. Ltd., which is the largest wind power producer in China and Asia. This dataset was used in the 
[Baidu KDD Cup in 2022](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/introduction)
 where teams competed for $35,000 in prize money.

The steps you will complete in this lab are:

1. Import Python packages

2. Load the dataset

3. Inspect and address missing values

4. Compute descriptive statistics

5. Select a subset of wind turbines (build your own wind farm)

6. Visualize the data6.1 Histograms6.2 Box/Violin plots6.3 Scatter Plot6.4 Pairplot6.5 Correlation Matrix6.6 Time Series
