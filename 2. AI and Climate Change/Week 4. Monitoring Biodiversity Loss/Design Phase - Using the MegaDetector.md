[__Open Lab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-and-climate-change/ungradedLab/wFSZ3/design-phase-using-the-megadetector/lab?path=%2Fnotebooks%2FC2_W4_Lab_1_design_phase_1.ipynb)

## Instructions

Welcome to the first design phase lab of this project. In this lab you will use the [MegaDetector model](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md) to automatically identify which images in your dataset contain animals and where in each image the animal can be found.

The steps you will complete in this notebook are the following:

1. Import Python packages

2. Crop images with MegaDetector

3. Square cropped images

4. Use MegaDetector output for cropping the region of interest

5. Process the dataset
