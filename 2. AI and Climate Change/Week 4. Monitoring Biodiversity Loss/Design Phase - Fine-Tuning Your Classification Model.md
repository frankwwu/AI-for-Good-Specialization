[__Open Lab__](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-and-climate-change/ungradedLab/17gWb/design-phase-fine-tuning-your-classification-model/lab?path=%2Fnotebooks%2FC2_W4_Lab_2_design_phase_2.ipynb)

# Instructions

In this lab you will develop a model for animal classification in the Karoo national park. More specifically, you'll fine tune a Neural Architecture Search Network ([NASNet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012)) that was pre-trained on the [ImageNet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/index.php).

The steps you will complete in this notebook are the following:

1. Import libraries

2. Load the data

3. Try out the original NASNet model

4. Balance dataset

5. Augment your data

6. Create your own model based on NASNet

7. Model Evaluation
