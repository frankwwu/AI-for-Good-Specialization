# Implement Phase - Object Detection Pipeline

[__Open Lab__](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-and-climate-change/ungradedLab/xwp6z/implement-phase-object-detection-pipeline/lab?path=%2Fnotebooks%2FC2_W4_Lab_3_Karoo_Implementation.ipynb)

## Instructions

In this notebook, you will implement a tool for detecting and classifying animals from the Karoo dataset.

As you verified during the design phase, the first prediction is not always the correct one. So, for doing this application useful you will annotate the picture with the best 3 predictions.

The steps you will complete in this notebook are the following:

1. Import Python packages
2. Load the metadata
3. Load the fine tuned model
4. Load the MegaDetector
5. Detect and classify animals
